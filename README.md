## How the Following Requirements are Implemented

* Basic Shapes
    * All the numbers displayed on the timer where drawn onto the canvas to meet this requirement.    
    * I've decided to implement a digital timer, allowing me to experiment with the polygraphic <br>
      design of each digit.
    * As for Arcs I've decided to implement 2 arcs growing in length as the timer increases.
        * The top arc represents elapsed minutes.
        * The bottom arc represents elapsed seconds.
* Rendered Text
    * The current date is rendered as test on the top left of the canvas.
* Image render
    * I've Decided to render an image of a clock, to match the theme of a timer program
* Loops, Interactivity, Animation
    * In my implementation, all there are inter-connected.
    * First for interactivity, there is a start timer button.
    * Once the button is clicked, Ive add a loop to update the <br>
      current elapsed time.
    * Lastly for the animation, after the elapsed time is updated <br>
      we must also update the UI to reflect this change. Once the UI <br>
      is updated, this creates a digital animation.
